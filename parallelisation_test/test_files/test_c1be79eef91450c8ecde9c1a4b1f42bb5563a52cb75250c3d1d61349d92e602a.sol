WeiFund v1.0

This contract creates a crowdfunding platform. Start, donate to, payout and 
refund crowdfunding campaigns on Ethereum.

If the campaign goal is reached or surpassed by stated expiry, all raised 
funds will be paid out to the campaign's beneficiary. If the campaign goal is 
not reached by the stated expiry, all funds are refundable back to oringial 
contributors. Campaigns may also select a configuration contract which can 
be used for customized outward extensibility of campaigns to contracts like 
token or registry systems.

Multiple contributions by the same account are allowed. Each contribution will
be treated as it's own contribution instance.
